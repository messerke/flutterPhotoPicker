# photo_timer_app

A new Flutter project for testing the functionality of getting the pictures from the phone storage.

## Getting Started

- uses Flutter
- works on Android (not tested on iOS)
- after launching you have 10 seconds to create your photos
- after 10 seconds the app will show your created photos
- check the console logs for permission grantedness
- if the app does not ask for permissions, add permissions to it by hand (settings -> apps -> <select the app> -> photos)
